## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20.x
- npm >= 10.x
- MongoDB running (for development/production)

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Environment Setup

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.development`, `.env.test`, etc. and update values accordingly.

Restart the server after changing `.env` files.

| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------|
| `npm run dev`        | Start development server with nodemon        |
| `npm run dev:debug`  | Start dev server with debugger attached       |
| `npm run lint`       | Run ESLint on source files                     |
| `npm run lint:fix`   | Run ESLint and fix auto-fixable issues        |
| `npm run test`       | Run tests once                                 |
| `npm run test:watch` | Run tests in watch mode                        |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Run tests with code coverage report         |
| `npm start`          | Start production server                        |

## Testing

- Tests are written with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest).
- Uses an in-memory MongoDB instance for isolated tests.
- Test coverage reports are generated by Jest.
- Run tests using `npm run test` or `npm run test:watch` for continuous testing during development.

## Code Quality

- ESLint is configured using a custom shared configuration package: [eslint-config-blazex](https://github.com/brijeshbhakta30/eslint-config-blazex). For detailed rules and usage, refer to the repository.
- `lint-staged` and `husky` are set up to automatically lint and test staged files before commit.
- Commit messages follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org).

## Environment Variables

- Configuration is managed via `.env` files per environment.
- Make sure to provide all required environment variables (see `.env.example`).
